# Week 4 Checkout Summary — Backend

## Overview (Week 4 — late October)
1. ### Standardized NOT_FOUND semantics
   - Introduced `ResourceNotFoundException` in the common layer and mapped it in `GlobalExceptionHandler` to HTTP 404 with error code `NOT_FOUND`.
   - Services throw the exception; controllers remain thin and rely on the centralized handler.
   - Added tests: service unit test for missing user and WebMvc test asserting the 404 envelope.

2. ### BAD_REQUEST mapping coverage
   - Added a focused WebMvc test to assert `IllegalArgumentException` is translated to HTTP 400 with `{ "error": "BAD_REQUEST" }`.
   - Keeps error envelope consistent and prevents controller-specific ad hoc responses.

3. ### Endpoint hardening for future admin/public profiles
   - Added a gated user read endpoint `GET /users/{id}` returning `PublicUserDto` (no email or sensitive fields).
   - Endpoint is disabled by default; enable with `sameboat.endpoints.user-read=true`.
   - Access control: only the authenticated user (self) or `ADMIN` may fetch. Tests are present but disabled until the feature is enabled for real environments.

4. ### OpenAPI & Docs
   - Updated `openapi/sameboat.yaml` to include `/api/version` and a reusable `ErrorResponse` schema enumerating current error codes (`UNAUTHENTICATED`, `BAD_CREDENTIALS`, `SESSION_EXPIRED`, `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `BAD_REQUEST`, `RATE_LIMITED`, `NOT_FOUND`, `INTERNAL_ERROR`).
   - `docs/Architecture.md`: added a Week 4 Backend Summary with the above items.
   - README: added Week 4 highlights, Windows `mvn` quoting note, and included `NOT_FOUND` in error catalog table.

5. ### Tests & Quality Gates
   - All tests pass locally (migration Testcontainers profile skipped without Docker).
   - JaCoCo instruction coverage: ~84% total (gate ≥ 70% remains green).

## Key Decisions & Rationale
- Centralize 404 behavior via a domain exception to reduce controller boilerplate and ensure consistent envelopes.
- Keep cross-user reads gated and least-privilege by default; only self or `ADMIN` can fetch when feature is enabled.
- Public profile DTO excludes email to reduce PII exposure; future public profile endpoint can reuse the same DTO or an even slimmer one.

## What Went Well
- Layering preserved (Controller → Service → Repository). Controllers remain thin and secure.
- Focused tests captured envelope behavior for both NOT_FOUND and BAD_REQUEST without bloating integration suites.
- OpenAPI is back in sync, making frontend consumption clearer.

## What I Struggled With
- Security slices in WebMvc tests required explicit authentication setup; solved with `@WithMockUser` or session cookie when appropriate.
- Property-gated endpoint meant careful test enable/disable to keep the suite green by default.

## Suggested Next Steps (Backend)
- When bringing up the admin console:
  - Enable `sameboat.endpoints.user-read=true` in admin/staging environments.
  - Add role-based method security (`@EnableMethodSecurity`) and migrate inline checks to `@PreAuthorize`.
  - Add integration tests for `403` (non-self, non-admin) and `200` for admin fetching other users.
- Consider adding a dedicated public profile route (e.g., `/profiles/{id}`) with no auth but constrained DTO.
- Continue ratcheting coverage toward 75% by adding small unit tests (e.g., more `UserService` edge cases, filter behaviors).

## Verification (Local)
- Run fast tests (Windows cmd):
```cmd
mvn "-Dskip.migration.test=false" test
```
- Full verify (tests + coverage gate):
```cmd
mvn "-Dskip.migration.test=false" verify
```
- Optional migration schema test (requires Docker/Testcontainers):
```cmd
mvn -Pwith-migration-test test
```
