# Week 3 Checkout Summary — Backend

## Overview (Week 3 — early October; spilled slightly into Oct 16)
1. ### Authentication Hardening
   - Enforced password complexity on registration (Bean Validation): minimum 8 characters and must include at least one uppercase, one lowercase, and one digit.
   - Added a naive in-memory rate limiter for login attempts (keyed by normalized email + client IP): 5 failures within 5 minutes returns HTTP 429 with `{ "error": "RATE_LIMITED" }`. Successful login resets the bucket.
   - Updated `README.md` to document password complexity, the `RATE_LIMITED` error code, and fixed sample cURL to use a compliant password.

2. ### Session Lifecycle Improvements
   - Implemented a scheduled session pruning job that deletes expired sessions hourly. Uses a JPQL bulk delete for reliability and runs within a transaction.
   - Enabled scheduling via `@EnableScheduling` in the Spring Boot application.
   - Verified via integration test that expired sessions are removed and valid ones are retained.

3. ### Tests & Quality Gates
   - Added focused tests: password complexity validation, login rate limiting, and session pruning behavior.
   - All tests pass locally; JaCoCo coverage gate (70%) continues to pass. Consider raising to 75% with additional unit tests next week.

4. ### Documentation & Governance
   - Created `docs/RISKS.md` to track known risks and mitigations (rate limiter scope, cookie security, pruning cadence, etc.).
   - Added a spike document `docs/spikes/jwt-session-tradeoffs.md` comparing JWT vs. opaque sessions and recommending sticking with opaque sessions for MVP, revisiting hybrid JWT later.
   - Expanded `README.md` with the new error code, auth notes, and corrected examples.

5. ### Security & Layering Integrity
   - Preserved controller → service → repository boundaries (no direct repository access from controllers).
   - Kept error envelopes consistent and minimal; logging avoids sensitive payloads. Rate limit triggers logged at INFO without leaking secrets.

## Key Decisions & Rationale
- Stay with opaque DB-backed sessions for MVP: simple revocation, predictable behavior, and minimal complexity. Re-evaluate a hybrid JWT approach when scaling beyond a single instance.
- Implement an in-memory rate limiter now (fast, simple) with a plan to move to Redis when horizontal scaling is introduced.
- Use an explicit JPQL bulk delete for session pruning instead of a derived delete method to ensure a true bulk operation with a reliable affected-row count.

## What Went Well
- Kept a clean Controller → Service → Repository layering; controllers remained thin and predictable.
- Validated early with Bean Validation and consistent error envelopes, aligning with SECURITY_BASELINE.
- Tests were focused and deterministic; local feedback loop stayed fast while keeping the 70% coverage gate green.
- The scheduling + JPQL bulk delete approach was simple and reliable, with clear, auditable behavior.
- Rate limiter logic had clear thresholds and reset rules, and negative paths were covered by tests.
- Documentation stayed in lockstep (README, RISKS, spike) which reduced back-and-forth and onboarding friction.
- Changes were incremental and scoped, making review and rollback straightforward.

## What I Struggled With
- Time-based behavior in tests (session expiry) required careful control to avoid flakiness; leaning on an injectable Clock and shorter TTLs helped stabilize assertions.
- Boundaries for rate limiting (email normalization, client IP handling, and proxy considerations) required trade-offs; captured residual risks in RISKS.md.
- Windows-specific build ergonomics (using `mvnw.cmd` correctly) caused some false starts; standardized command snippets in Verification to prevent repeats.
- Deciding how to expose the app version cleanly; the custom `/api/version` returned `"unknown"` without explicit wiring. This needs a follow-up to use Actuator info or MANIFEST-based injection.
- Keeping Testcontainers optional while using H2 for speed meant double-checking JPQL compatibility for bulk deletes; verified behavior and left deeper Postgres coverage for a future profile.
- Balancing scope creep (e.g., Redis-backed rate limiter) with MVP needs; deferred advanced infrastructure while documenting the path forward.

## Suggested Next Steps (Backend)
- Consider moving the rate limiter to Redis for multi-instance readiness; make thresholds configurable via properties.
- Raise the coverage gate to 75% by adding more unit tests (SessionService touch/expiry, UserService normalization/patch edges).
- Add OpenAPI (dev-only) for API discovery; export a static spec for the frontend.
- Consider session rotation on sensitive actions and evaluate refresh-token strategy as part of the hybrid JWT spike.

## Verification (Local)
- Run tests (Windows cmd):
```cmd
cmd.exe /d /c "cd /d C:\Users\nickh\Documents\MyWebsites\SameBoat\sameboat-backend && mvnw.cmd -ntp -Dskip.migration.test=true -DtrimStackTrace=false test"
```
- Full verify (tests + coverage gate):
```cmd
cmd.exe /d /c "cd /d C:\Users\nickh\Documents\MyWebsites\SameBoat\sameboat-backend && mvnw.cmd -ntp -Dskip.migration.test=true -DtrimStackTrace=false verify"
```
- Include migration schema test profile (optional):
```cmd
cmd.exe /d /c "cd /d C:\Users\nickh\Documents\MyWebsites\SameBoat\sameboat-backend && mvnw.cmd -ntp -Pwith-migration-test -DtrimStackTrace=false test"
```
