## Timeline (Semester plan)

Assuming you start now (mid-September) and finish by ~Dec 15:

### Phase 1: Planning & Design (Sept 10–Sept 25)

- Finalize MVP feature list (storytelling, roles, trust metric, connection system).
- Choose tech stack (likely React + backend + DB; keep it simple at MVP stage).
- Draft wireframes for UI (story submission, profile, browsing).
- Write technical plan (data models for users, stories, trust score).

#### Deliverable: Wireframes + technical plan + refined scope statement.

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (Sept 26–Oct 31)

- Week 1–2: Build authentication + user roles system.
- Week 3: Implement story submission + profile integration.
- Week 4–5: Build basic trust metric (e.g., role verification, peer ratings, or engagement-based score).
- Week 6: Create connection/discovery feature (matching algorithm or search).

#### Deliverable: A working “Tell your story & connect” MVP.

### Phase 3: Expanded Features (Nov 1–Nov 20)

- Implement trigger warning system (if time allows).
- Add polish: basic styling, accessibility, simple moderation tools.
- Optimize DB + API calls.

#### Deliverable: Polished MVP with optional advanced features.

### Phase 4: Presentation Prep & Refinement (Nov 21–Dec 15)

- Create demo-ready version (stable environment, seeded with example users/stories).
- Prepare poster/slide deck for honors competition.
- Rehearse demo presentation.

#### Deliverable: Final presentation materials + working demo for competition.
